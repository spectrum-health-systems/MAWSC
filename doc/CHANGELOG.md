# Version 2.0
`INFO` Application rewrite.<br>

<br>

# Version 1.0

## v1.0.4.0
`FIXED` MAWSC temp/ path was incorrct.

<br>

## v1.0.3.0
`FIXED` MAWSC repository path was incorrect.

<br>

## v1.0.2.0
`FIXED` IIS Staging path was incorrect.

<br>

## v1.0.1.0
`FIXED`<br>
Application crashed if the IIS Staging path doesn't exist because originally I was assuming it would just exist. That's probably not a good idea, so now MAWSC will create the IIS Staging path if it does not exist.

<br>

## v1.0
`INFO` Initial release
