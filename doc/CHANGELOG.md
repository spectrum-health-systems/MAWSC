# MAWS Commander Changelog

## v1.2

## v1.0.4
* `FIXED` MAWSC temp/ path was incorrct.

## v1.0.3
* `FIXED` MAWSC repository path was incorrect.

## v1.0.2
* `FIXED` IIS Staging path was incorrect.

## v1.0.1
* `FIXED` Application crashed if the IIS Staging path doesn't exist because originally I was assuming it would just exist. That's probably not a good idea, so now MAWSC will create the IIS Staging path if it does not exist.

## v1.0.0
* `INFO` Initial release
