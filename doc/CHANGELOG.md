# MAWS Commander Changelog

## v2.0
* `INFO` Application rewrite.

## v1.0.4.0
* `FIXED` MAWSC temp/ path was incorrct.

## v1.0.3.0
* `FIXED` MAWSC repository path was incorrect.

## v1.0.2.0
* `FIXED` IIS Staging path was incorrect.

## v1.0.1.0
* `FIXED` Application crashed if the IIS Staging path doesn't exist because originally I was assuming it would just exist. That's probably not a good idea, so now MAWSC will create the IIS Staging path if it does not exist.

* `INFO` Initial release
